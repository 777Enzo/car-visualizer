# Car Market Visualizer (USA)

Car Visualizer project based on the [MarketCheck API](https://docs.marketcheck.com/docs/get-started/api/introduction).

A **portfolio-ready data analytics project** focused on aggregating vehicle listing data across the United States to analyze **pricing trends, mileage impact, and regional variance**, with optional **geo-personalized insights**.

This project functions as a **pricing intelligence dashboard**, designed to help consumers understand fair market value and regional pricing dynamics.

## Refined Project Definition

**Car Market Visualizer (USA)**  
A data analytics application that aggregates vehicle listing data across the U.S. to analyze:

- Pricing trends over time  
- Mileage-adjusted pricing  
- Regional price variance  
- Market health indicators  

Geo-personalization allows users to filter results by **city, state, or radius**, with nationwide aggregation as the default.

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Data Ingestion (MarketCheck API)

**Key endpoints:**

- Listings search  
- Historical pricing (if available per listing)  
- Vehicle attributes (year, make, model, trim)  
- Location (city, state, ZIP, latitude/longitude)  
- Mileage  
- Price  

**Stored fields:**

- `price`
- `mileage`
- `year`
- `days_on_market`
- `city`
- `state`
- `dealer_vs_private`
- `listing_date`

---

### 2. Aggregated Metrics

For a selected vehicle (example: *2018 Honda Accord EX-L*):

#### Pricing
- Median price (preferred over mean)
- 25th / 75th percentile pricing
- Price vs. mileage regression
- Outlier detection (overpriced listings)

#### Mileage
- Median mileage by model year
- Price depreciation per 10,000 miles

#### Market Health
- Average days on market
- Active inventory count
- Price dispersion (market volatility)

---

### 3. Visualization Layer

#### Sparkline (Primary Visualization)

- X-axis: Time (last 30 / 90 / 180 days)
- Y-axis: Median price
- Optional rolling median smoothing

Additional visualizations:

- Price vs. mileage scatter plot
- Box plot by city or state
- Price distribution histogram
- Heat map (optional / advanced)

---

### 4. Geofencing & Personalization

**User inputs:**

- City + radius (e.g., **Austin, TX — 50 miles**)
- State
- Nationwide (default)

**Logic:**

- Filter listings using latitude/longitude + Haversine distance
- Fallback to state or national aggregates when local data is sparse

**Transparency example:**

> “Based on 312 listings within 50 miles”

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python
- FastAPI
- Pandas / NumPy
- SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite initially)
- Scheduled background jobs for data refresh

### Frontend & Visualization
- Streamlit (fastest MVP)
  - Optional: Plotly Dash for advanced layouts
- Plotly for interactive charts and sparklines

### Data Storage
- Raw listings table
- Precomputed aggregated metrics table (for performance)

## Example User Flow

1. User selects:
   - Year: 2018  
   - Make: Honda  
   - Model: Accord  
   - Radius: 50 miles  

2. Application returns:
   - Sparkline of median prices (last 90 days)
   - Estimated fair price range
   - Mileage-adjusted price estimate
   - Local vs national price comparison

---

## Resume Bullet

> Built a U.S.-wide vehicle market analytics dashboard using the MarketCheck API to aggregate and analyze pricing, mileage, and regional trends across thousands of listings. Implemented geofenced personalization, pricing distribution analysis, and time-series visualizations to estimate fair market value.

---

## Stretch Features

- Price prediction model (linear regression or XGBoost)
- Overpriced / underpriced listing classification
- Comparison against KBB price ranges (manual or reference-based)
- Price drop alerts (e.g., “5% decrease in your area”)
- Dealer vs. private seller pricing gap analysis

---

## Important Notes

MarketCheck API constraints:
- Rate limits
- Potential paywalls for historical data

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Aggressive caching
- Daily snapshot storage
- Positioning as a research and analytics tool, not a live scraper

This approach is fully acceptable for a portfolio project.

## Next Steps

Optional extensions:
- Database schema design
- API endpoint selection
- UI wireframes
- Sparkline calculation logic
- Conversion into a **2–3 week execution plan**
