1 - try to pull the data from an api. via Pandas DF
    - API reqs
    - JSON
    - Fields (price, mileage, year, location)
        - 02/03/2026 - We need to chunk out the DF for analysis. This is important. 44 different fields with some of them nested. Will help understand the data b4 the analysis, etc.


2 - set up db
    - tables?
    - columns and types
    - primary keys 


3 - export data from local ipynb to sql server db 
    - Writing the DataFrame to the DB (to_sql in Pandas works, or pyodbc/SQLAlchemy)
